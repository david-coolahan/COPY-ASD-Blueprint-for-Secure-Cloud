The below tables outline the _as built_ configuration for ASD's _Blueprint for Secure Cloud_ (the Blueprint) for the Microsoft Defender portal at the following URL:

<https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/endpoints/onboarding>

The settings described on these pages provide a baseline implementation for a system configured using the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the guidance provided by the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.
