### Labelling and classification

The labelling and classification of information are key capabilities within the Microsoft Purview suite:

- Labels are logical tags, unique to each Purview tenant or organisation, that enable the control and categorisation of information in accordance with operational, security and privacy requirements.
- Classifiers are patterns and rules that assist the identification of data types within information.

#### Implementing sensitivity labels

Sensitivity labels are applied or associated with certain types of emails, documents and containers within Microsoft 365 services, applications and endpoints, this process is primarily to provide content marking and to mitigate unauthorised access.

#### Implementing sensitive information types

Sensitive information types are pattern-based classifiers that can be developed to identify information with a degree of confidence for any number of use cases. While the development of sensitive information types can be straightforward, implementing them can be difficult without knowledge of the organisational specific context in which information is stored, used and shared. Implementation without considering this context can result in excess false positive or false negatives, excess administrative alerts or events, and a poor user experience.

| Implementing sensitive information types | Provide sensitive information types with base patterns | Enable the detection of sensitive and security classified information for auto-labelling and data loss prevention |

{{% /alert %}}

Auto-labelling and data loss prevention policy configurations using sensitive information types have not been specified. However, organisations should use the provided [sensitive information type](/configuration/purview/information-protection/classifiers/sensitive-info-types) configurations as a starting point to develop their own, organisational specific policies. Such policies can be used in simulation mode to assess their effectiveness before being set to enforce. Example use cases include:

- Detecting unlabelled information, or emails or documents with markings but without a label
- Detecting mis-labelled information
- Detecting malicious label downgrades
- Mapping historical PSPF markings to current equivalents
- Detecting sensitive personal, financial or technical information
- Detecting SECRET or TOP SECRET information

#### Applying labels

Sensitivity labels can be applied by default, manually or automatically, with the method selected being dependent on the Microsoft 365 service, application or endpoint used, and an organisation's ability to implement classifiers.

Default labels are not able to be widely used in a security context without understanding the risks associated with mis-labelled information, and the potential lack of personal accountability for PSPF marking decisions. Default labels are discussed in the context of SharePoint Online [below](#labelling-microsoft-365-groups-and-sharepoint-online-document-libraries). Auto-labelling has similar risks which can be minimised by ensuring the trigger for an auto-labelling action is based on relatively deterministic conditions, like an email's X-Protective-Marking X-header value, for example. Residual risks can be mitigated to a degree by the use of sensitive information types (or other classifiers) to detect, alert and prompt the user to take action on mis-labelled or incorrectly marked information.

Auto-labelling can be performed via client-side (end-user application) or service-side (Microsoft 365 service) mechanisms, with the latter offering more flexibility in choosing conditions for labelling triggers. Service-side auto-labelling polices are able to be used in conjunction with data loss prevention policies to apply email X-header and subject markings to incoming and outgoing emails, respectively, and are discussed in more detail in the [email handling](/design/shared-services/purview/email-handling) page.

##### Labelling Microsoft 365 groups and SharePoint Online document libraries

Sensitivity labels applied to containers such as Microsoft 365 Groups and SharePoint Online sites, differ in function from those applied to document libraries:

- Applying a label to a container configures access controls, including privacy settings and external sharing restrictions, and enable use with Conditional Access.
- Applying a label to a document library sets a default label that will be inherited by any new document uploaded without a label. This inheritance does not override a label that has already been applied to a document, regardless of its priority.

{{% alert title="Labelling SharePoint Online sites and libraries" color="info" %}}

Site sensitivity labels are visible in the group tag banner and may differ from the default labels applied to the site's document libraries. Default labels for document libraries are [configured in library settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/add-a-sensitivity-label-to-sharepoint-document-library-54b1602b-db0a-4bcb-b9ac-5e20cbc28089) and are not externally visible.

{{% /alert %}}

Default labels help prevent under-classification by automatically assigning a baseline level of protection to new content. They are especially useful for unsupported file types that cannot be directly labelled or marked, ensuring minimum access controls are enforced and reducing the risk of inappropriate sharing or misclassification.

#### Changing labels

Similar to the initial application of a sensitivity label, a label can also be changed manually or automatically depending on the Microsoft 365 service, application or endpoint used, and an organisation's ability to implement classifiers.

{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Label inheritance from email attachments" color="info" %}}

The _email inherits highest priority label from attachments_ feature applies a sensitivity label to an unlabelled email or overrides a lower-priority, automatically applied label. However, it does not override a label that a user has manually applied, such as when a user drafts an email and labels it before attaching a document. In such cases, the user's explicit action takes precedence over automatic inheritance.

{{% /alert %}}

#### Label naming, priority and grouping

While a sensitivity label's name can be arbitrary, it's important that users are easily able to associate the label with its purpose of controlling or categorising information. Labels can be created with a priority order and grouped to determine how they will display in applications, the priority of auto-labelling rules will apply when labelling conflicts occur, and the user experience when changing labels or moving labelled information.

{{% alert title="Parent label deprecation" color="warning" %}}

Microsoft is deprecating parent sensitivity labels in favour of label groups.

During the migration process, sublabels may be automatically generated for each existing parent label. These newly created sublabels may be included in publishing policies, making them visible and selectable by end users.

Organisations are encouraged to conduct a review of label configurations prior to migration, and to validate the post-migration labelling scheme and associated policy behaviours.

For guidance on preparing for and mitigating potential impacts, please refer to [Microsoft's label migration documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/purview/migrate-sensitivity-label-scheme).

#### Label publishing

Sensitivity labels must be published to specific users or groups which then allows them to be applied in supported Microsoft 365 applications and workflows.

#### Access control

The access controls associated with sensitivity labels use Azure Rights Management usage rights and can be used to not only ensure the correct users are permitted or denied access, but can be used to apply encryption to documents, control offline access to information, and to restrict the specific operations allowed on information. These controls provide an effective means of mitigating risks associated with unauthorised access, and also serve to compliment and backstop many other related Microsoft 365 access controls and third party security services.

#### External sharing

A sensitivity label can be used to apply external sharing settings that provide restricted external sharing settings to what may be configured in SharePoint Online and at the container level. If there is a conflict in sharing permissions, the most restrictive sharing settings will always apply.
